# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to collect publically available earthquake data and to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks

To complete this project, I used GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website. I retrieved geographical coordinates and earthquake magnitudes for the last seven days (9/2/2022 - 9/9/2022) and added that data to a map.

## Approach

I used JavaScript and the D3.js library to pull the coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes from the GeoJSON data and the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request. I also created interactivity for the earthquake data via map legends.
